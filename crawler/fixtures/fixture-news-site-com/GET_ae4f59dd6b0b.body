    <h1>Local Tech Company Expands Operations to Northern Ontario</h1>
    <p class="byline">By Jane Smith | Published January 15, 2026</p>
    <p>A Sudbury-based technology company announced major expansion plans today that will bring hundreds of new jobs to Northern Ontario communities. The company, which specializes in cloud computing and data analytics, plans to open new offices in Timmins, Sault Ste. Marie, and Thunder Bay.</p>
    <p>The expansion is expected to create approximately 200 new positions over the next two years, with roles ranging from software development to customer support. Company CEO John Anderson said the move reflects growing demand for tech services in northern communities.</p>
    <p>"We've seen tremendous growth in the past three years, and we believe there's significant untapped talent in Northern Ontario," Anderson said in a statement. "This expansion allows us to serve our clients better while investing in communities that have been underserved by the tech sector."</p>
    <p>The provincial government has pledged $5 million in support through its Northern Development Fund to assist with the expansion. Minister of Northern Development Sarah Chen praised the company's commitment to the region.</p>
    <p>"This investment shows that Northern Ontario is an attractive destination for technology companies," Chen said. "We're committed to building the infrastructure and workforce needed to support continued growth in our northern communities."</p>
    <p>The first new office is expected to open in Timmins by June 2026, with the remaining locations following by the end of the year. The company has already begun recruitment efforts and plans to partner with local colleges and universities for training programs.</p>
    <p>Industry analysts say the expansion is part of a broader trend of technology companies moving operations outside of major urban centres, driven by lower costs and improved internet infrastructure in smaller communities.</p>
