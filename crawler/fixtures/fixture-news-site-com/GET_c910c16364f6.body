    <h1>Three Arrested Following Downtown Robbery Spree</h1>
    <p class="byline">By Mike Johnson | Published January 20, 2026</p>
    <p>Greater Sudbury Police have arrested three suspects in connection with a string of armed robberies that targeted downtown businesses over the past week. The arrests were made during an early morning operation on Tuesday.</p>
    <p>Police say the suspects, aged 22, 25, and 31, are believed responsible for at least five separate robbery incidents at convenience stores and gas stations in the downtown core. In each case, the suspects allegedly brandished weapons and demanded cash from employees.</p>
    <p>"These arrests represent a significant breakthrough in our investigation," said Inspector David Williams of the Greater Sudbury Police. "We take violent crime very seriously, and our officers worked around the clock to identify and apprehend these individuals."</p>
    <p>No injuries were reported during any of the robberies, though several employees reported being traumatized by the incidents. Victim services have been offered to all affected workers.</p>
    <p>The three suspects face multiple charges including armed robbery, uttering threats, and possession of weapons. They are scheduled to appear in court later this week. Police say the investigation is ongoing and additional charges may be laid.</p>
    <p>Downtown business owners expressed relief at the arrests. The Sudbury Downtown Business Association had been calling for increased police presence in the area following the crime spree.</p>
    <p>"Our members were frightened and some were considering closing early," said association president Lisa Park. "We're grateful to the police for their swift action in this matter."</p>
